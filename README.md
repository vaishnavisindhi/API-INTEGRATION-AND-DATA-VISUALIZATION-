ðŸ“„ Project Description

In this project, I created a real-time news visualization dashboard using Python. 
The goal was to fetch the latest headlines using a public API and represent the data 
visually. I used the NewsAPI to collect current headlines from the sports category. 
The API integration was done using the requests library, and the headline text data was 
processed to extract key words.For visualization, I used the WordCloud and matplotlib 
libraries to generate a word cloud â€” a graphical representation of the most frequently occurring words 
in the news titles. This word cloud provides a quick visual summary of trending topics in sports news. 
The project demonstrates my understanding of API integration, basic data processing, and creative data visualization in Python.
